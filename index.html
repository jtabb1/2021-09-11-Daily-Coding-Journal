    <p> 
      Coding-wise, this morning I did some reading for my 
      Flatiron School phase 4 project.

    <p> 
      Today I intend to go to my 
      Amazon job, go to the MVA, and work on my project.

    <p> 
      Today I went to my Amazon job, went to the MVA, and 
      worked on my project in the sense that I got a similar 
      Flatiron School code example to work for at least 
      one resource.
